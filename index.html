             <h4>HTML 5 & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</h4>
             <p>A simple website designed to introduce a food truck business. It gives brief descriptions of their products and services with a list of today's specials. There are also links that will take you to their menus, locations, reviews and a gallery of their food photos.
               This website is short and concise with easy to use links that quickly take the user to the information that is offered.</p>

              <h3>Recipe Collection</h3>
              <p>This is a collection of someone's recipes. It does not look very tasty as I see the first recipe starts with the word gluten, as in gluten free. Right away this makes me
                suspicious. About 99 percent of gluten free products I've tried have not been very tasty. However, those cookies in the picture do look good. They remind me of shortbread cookies
                which are my favorite. I think the cookies in the picture are not from that recipe. This is where fake news comes from!</p>

              <h3>I love launching into new adventures!</h3>
              <p>My passion for learning new things pushed me into studying web design. With the restrictions from Covid-19 and the early darkness of winter
                 I have found the time I need to expand my skills in web development. In school I took many art classes along with computer programming and
                 math, which helped me to develope a keen sense of attention to detail. I have worked many years in the service industry and am very comfortable
                  with providing customer service. I look forward to designing new and fun ways to share your business with the world!</p>
